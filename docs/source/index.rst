PyMCNP Documentation
====================

PyMCNP is a Python package and command line interface (CLI) for
interacting with `Monte Carlo N-Particle <https://mcnp.lanl.gov>`_
(MCNP). PyMCNP parsers MCNP input and output files. It can also create
MCNP input files, as well as, visualize the simulation geometry, and
runs MCNP simulations (including automated parallel runs on single
desktops, multiple computers, or SLURM enabled clusters).

PyMCNP allows to automate parameter scans, split long runs in many
smaller runs for easy parallelization, automated optimization of
parameters.
