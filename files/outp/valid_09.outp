         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 warning.       1 of the     1 tally fluctuation chart bins did not pass all 10 statistical checks.
