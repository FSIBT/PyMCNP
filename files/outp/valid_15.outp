 normed average tally per history  = 8.43800E-01          unnormed average tally per history  = 8.43800E-01

 (largest  tally)/(average tally)  = 1.18511E+00          (largest  tally)/(avg nonzero tally)= 1.00000E+00

 if the largest  history score sampled so far were to occur on the next history, the tfc bin quantities would change as follows:

      estimated quantities           value at nps           value at nps+1           value(nps+1)/value(nps)-1.

 the 100 largest  history tallies appear to have a  maximum value of about 1.00000E+00
 the large score tail of the empirical history score probability density function appears to have no unsampled regions.

 fom = (histories/minute)*(f(x) signal-to-noise ratio)**2 = (6.337E+06)*( 2.324E+00)**2 = (6.337E+06)*(5.402E+00) = 3.423E+07
 print table 161 cannot be done for this tally because all tallies were between 1.00000E+00 and 1.25893E+00 which is one tally bin.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        1   missed  1 of 10 tfc bin checks: the figure of merit has a trend during the last half of the problem                       
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 warning.       1 of the     1 tally fluctuation chart bins did not pass all 10 statistical checks.
